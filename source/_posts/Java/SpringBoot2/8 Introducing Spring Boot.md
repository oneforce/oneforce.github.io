Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can run. We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries, so that you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

You can use Spring Boot to create Java applications that can be started by using java -jar or more traditional war deployments. We also provide a command line tool that runs “spring scripts”.

Our primary goals are:

* Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting-started experience for all Spring development.
* Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.
* Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (such as embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration).
* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.

spring boot 可以轻松的创建独立的，生产环境的基于spring的应用。我们整合了spring平台和第三方库，这样可以让您快速的开始而不至于大惊小怪。绝大部分spring boot的应用就需要非常少的配置。

你可以用spring boot来创建基于`java -jar`启动的应用，或者更加传统的war部署方式。我们也提供了命令行工具来执行"spring scripts"

我们的主要原则是

* 对所有spring开发提供更加快速、更加广泛的入门体验
* Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.
* 提供大型项目中常见的大量非功能性需求（例如内嵌服务器、安全、指标、健康检查和配置管理
* 绝对没有代码生成，并且不需要XML配置
